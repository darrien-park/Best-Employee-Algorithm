# Best-Employee-Algorithm

## Description
Given a list of employees and their respective interview scores, this java-based program compares the scores of the hired (best) employee by:

  1) Systematically interviewing each employee (Complexity O(n)) vs. 2)applying an improved more efficient algorithm. 
  
The new algorithm interviews the first n/e employees and finds the best applicant. The next interviewee who has a higher score than the current best is the applicant to be hired. This algorithm will find the best possible employee with a probability of 1/e.
